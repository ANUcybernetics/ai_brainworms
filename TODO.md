# TODO

(in no particular order)

- rotary encoder using <https://hexdocs.pm/rotary_encoder/RotaryEncoder.html>
  (see if changes are necessary for circuits v2)
- moar tests
- add noise generator (for "animating" the wires)
- add "wiggle back and forth" detection for reset training? maybe.

## maybe... but not necessarily

- get EXLA compiling (or download pre-built binary)
- add a UI (for the rpi4 touchscreen) with
  [Scenic](https://hexdocs.pm/scenic/welcome.html)
